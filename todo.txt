- matchup data?
    this would be a huge endeavor
    a lot of time fixing entries manually...
    fuck
    yea this sucks

- alternate plan:
    use r1 and r2 pairings, then only reported results of r3
    would need two different parsing functions, but should
    be more comprehensive...

- deck non-mirror winrate
    we probably get this for free after doing all matchup data
    yea. add to decks csv
